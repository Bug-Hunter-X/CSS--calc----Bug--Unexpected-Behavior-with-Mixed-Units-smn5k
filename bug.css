The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10px + 5%);` might not calculate as you anticipate, or even worse, might cause unexpected rendering failures. The issue stems from inconsistent handling of units within the `calc()` function.  Mixing percentages and pixels directly within a single `calc()` expression without proper parentheses can lead to errors.
